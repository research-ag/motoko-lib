See [here](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/ "MkDocs") to install MkDocs.

Check out `motoko-lib` to a local working directory. In that directory run `mkdocs serve` and see the result at `http://locahost:8000/`. 
Now edit the files in `docs` and see the live updates in the browser.

When satisfied commit the changes and push them to a PR.

When the PR is approved and merged then run `mkdocs gh-deploy` in the repository's working directory. This will deploy the new version to these [github pages](https://research-ag.github.io/motoko-lib/).
